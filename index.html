                <p>As a piece of technology that has only become in popular use recently, Virtual Reality (often abbreviated to VR) has shown itself useful in quite a few situations.</p> 
                <p>Research papers suggest it's potentially effective in learning, while it concurrently makes itself useful in gaming and entertainment.</p>

                <h2>Artifical Intelligence</h2>
                <img class="right" src="images/AIImage.jpg" alt="Uses of Artificial Intelligence" width="300" height="200">
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (or AI) is another area of Computer Science that has improved exponentially in the past few years. Facial and imagery recognition have become particularly potent as data sets have become easier to trawl through and analyze.</p>
                <p>This has also, naturally, raised ethical concerns as to the power that machines should be able to have, and to what extent machines should be able to make decisions for humans.</p>

                <img class="left" src="images/deepdream.jpg" alt="Uses in Media Manipulation" width="300" height="200">
                <p>All types of media, from images to video to music, have been influenced by new and flourishing trends in Computer Science. This is for better or worse, given raising concerns relating to fake information being spread.</p>
                <p>But this still comes with a variety of benefits, including improved video and image editing software and the ability to improve the quality of content created.</p>

                <p>The Internet acts as a brilliant repository of information for both students and the average person. It's designed to be as accessible as possible, and is one of the greatest modern examples of how information can travel and be exchanged according to present standards.</p>
                <p>Many older standards have been outclassed by technological advancements that simply allow for more accessible researching or studying, such as comparing the time taken sifting through a thick glossary to searching for a webpage.</p>
